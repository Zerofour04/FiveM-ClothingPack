## ℹ️Information
- Hey everyone! Two years ago, a friend and I created this clothes pack and decided to share it with the community.
- We put a lot of effort into providing a diverse selection of clothes.
- If you enjoy it, please consider giving it a ⭐️ star!
  
### This pack includes:
- Hairs
- Accessories
- Shoes
- Pants
- Vest
- Wristwatches
 ### ⚠️ This pack replaces most of the clothing!

 ## 💌Credits
- I'd also like to mention that the content of this pack is mainly sourced from 5MODS, as there hasn't been a comparable package available until now. A big thank you to the original creators for their fantastic work! Feel free to contact me if there are specific contents you'd like to have removed!


## 🧱Requirements & ⚙️Configuration
- You need a [Cfx.re Element Club Argentum 💿 Key](https://www.patreon.com/fivem) to stream the clothes.
